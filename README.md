<img src="https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/acdodd17/generate-README"  />

## DESCTIPTION 
This application allows users to generate a quality README.md file using Node.js in the command line. User input is collecting using 'inquirer' and 'file-system' to generate markdown and write a new file. 

## USER STORY
```
As a developer
I want a README.md generator 
So that I can quickly create a professional README.md file for a new project
```

## INSTALLATION
- `git clone` this repository to use locally 
- run `npm init` to install all the necessary npm packages
- run `npm install inquirer` to allow for user input

## USAGE
After runing `node index.js` in the command line to initialize the application, answer all prompts to generate a new README.md file for your project. You will find a new .md file with the name of your project as the title.
